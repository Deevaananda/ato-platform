## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)
1. Build Docker image with production configuration
2. Deploy to container orchestration platform
3. Configure environment variables and secrets
4. Set up monitoring and logging

### Option 2: Traditional Server Deployment
1. Install Node.js runtime and dependencies
2. Build application for production
3. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
4. Set up process management (PM2)

### Option 3: Cloud Platform Deployment
1. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
2. Configure database connection
3. Set up environment variables
4. Enable monitoring and alerts

## Environment Configuration

Create `.env.production` with:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./prod.db"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"

# Email Service
SMTP_HOST="smtp.your-provider.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-email@domain.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-password"

# SMS Service (Twilio)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your-twilio-sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your-twilio-token"
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER="+1234567890"

# Push Notifications
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY="your-vapid-public-key"
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY="your-vapid-private-key"

# External Integrations
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/..."
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-org.webhook.office.com/..."

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN="https://your-sentry-dsn"
```
